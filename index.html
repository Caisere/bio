                        <p>
                            I'm <span>Elegbede Omoshola Monday,</span>  proudly from Lagos, Nigeria, and a graduate of <span>Physics (Electronics)</span>  from <span>The Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA).</span>  Currently, I'm on an exciting journey to build a career in tech. I'm studying <span>Frontend Engineering</span> at AltSchool Africa, with the ultimate goal of becoming a Full-stack Developer. As the saying goes, <em>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,"</em> and I'm taking each step with purpose and determination. Coding has become more than just a skill for me, it is a passion I'm committed to turning it into a daily habit. Every line of code I write is a step closer to my dream of creating solutions that solve real-world problems. <br>
                            Football has always been one of my greatest joys, whether Iâ€™m playing on the field or cheering from the sidelines. Recently, 
                            though, Iâ€™ve discovered a new love: coding. Itâ€™s a passion that fuels my creativity and drives me to improve every day.
                            The fear of being a graduate without a skill keeps me motivated, but even more so, Iâ€™m inspired by the belief that technology is the future of everything. I want to use my skills to make meaningful impacts, solving problems that benefit many people. <em>As the proverb says, "He who climbs a good tree is given a push," and Iâ€™m determined to climb as high as I can in this field.</em>
